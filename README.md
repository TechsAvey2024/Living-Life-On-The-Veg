## UX
---
### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Living Life On The Veg's target users are:
* Aged 16+
* Past/future health experts
* People interested in learning tips and tricks for growing food
* Have an interest in changing there lifestyles

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
* Videos that provide inspiration and make the lifestyle choice look desirable
* Helpful guidance on routes available
* Recommendations for where and what to do to achieve this lifestyle

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to provide icons and also animation at the bottom due to the overwhelming amount of information at first glance as this is often the reason people are put off.

Due to the age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site on their mobile phones and therefore creating something responsive is integral to the design.

### **Scope**
In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Header with a background image of some Runner-Peas in my garden and menu bar , to navigate to various sections of the page
- Growing section full of tips for growing food
- Videos with information on growing food
- Sign Up form
- Links to affiliate/inspired social media pages

### **Structure** 

This is a three-page website, I chose the following order for the information 'Home > The Human Body > Lets Grow > Keep in Touch', as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. The text blocks are broken up with images to ensure interest is kept and there is no information overload at any point. There is a simple sign up form for users to sign up to Living Life On The Veg.

### **Skeleton**

[Wireframes](/docs/wireframes.pdf)

Please note the actual website has changed slightly from these wireframes.

Whilst building the website I felt that there were sections with too much information and also i didnt feel it worked once i had it in place with images and my content for this reason I opted to go for the animation approach as i wanted to see how it worked and looked overall.


### **Surface**

I chose a colour palette based around a green & beige as these colours remind me of the outdoors and also resembles the theme, I want the users of this website to be able to get clear information easily and also have videos to watch instead of reading and believe these colours will help to do this. 

I used Google fonts 'Cookie' and 'Sans-Serif' across the entire website, I felt 'Cookie' was a fun text and stood out on the page but I also wanted something easier to read for the large blocks of texts which is why I chose 'Sans-Serif' for the body text.

---

## **Features**

This is a fully responsive website that was designed desktop-first which i later learnt was the wrong way to do this, the page is divided into the four sections listed in the navbar. All of the headings use the font Cookie and the body text is Sans-Serif, this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design. 

### *Navbar*
The navbar is placed on the bottom of a responsive image which acts as a header, when viewed on smaller screens I opted for the menu to collapse into a hamburger icon as I still wanted to image to be seen. The image I have chosen is representative of the site's theme, it immediately encourages the user to be encourages to grow and entices them to read further. 


### *Unlocking The Benefits*
This page is to guide users towards a healthy lifestyle and give them information they didnt know previously and also has a hero image and some health tips with an animation at the bottom for tablet amd desktop users with a sign in section at the bottom.  
Front Top

### *The Human Body*
This page starts with an H2 heading and is then followed by a series of "li" elements, this structure is used to provide clarity of the items within this section and make it easy to understand at a glance. This also allows the users to direct their attention to a particular section they a more interested in with the bold text. i have also added two videos for users to watch.

### *Learn to Grow*
This page includes the most information and so I wanted to include icons alongside text. The title is an H2 element, this is followed by a concise review of how to grow. The review is built using ul and li elements with icons from FontAwesome. 
There is then a separate div that contains two videos of information regarding the text provided,

### *Inspirations*

This is a dropdown menu linking the users to the official websites where i gathered alot of my information, i went for the same colours and wanted to make it so the user can visit any of the websites without losing this site by using "target:_blank".

### *Help Us Grow*
This is a transparent signup form that will allow the user to sign up for Living Life On The Veg's to become a member. There is an H2 providing information regarding the form and an animation with leaves falling along with a boy on a bicycle, The form uses 2 elements, 1 text input and a password input. They are all required therefore all information is necessary to submit the form. The colour pallet used is the same across the site.
